    Hello there, Thank you for showing
    interest in my profile. Here is a quick intro about me.
    My interest with human ressources started way back, when
    I had to make a career choice. When every one were lured
    by the glamour of the IT industry I was drawn towards the
    people who work in them.The same draw made me complete a bachelors in computer applications and honing my skills
    with a masters in business specialising in human resources. From sourcing qualified candidates to administering
    benefits my focus through my tenure
    has been on attracting and retaining the best talent. I want to work to continue to utilize that expertise to
    ensure Volvo group grows as the most effective automobile processing platform in the market.

    best results and work equally towards the greater goal to connect with a community leading to universal happiness
    and prosperity.
